SUDOKU:
  - You have two options, either to play a randomly generated board, or to import your own (must be valid)
  - There is no difficult setting, but you can change it by going into boardFuncs.py --> boardGenerateRandom() -> difficulty
  - For the board import, the board are being solved using backtracking
     -it works for all valid boards, though some boards may have multiple solutions, depending on what you import
  - You can play around with the board import if you want, but must be valid (no sudoku rule violations)
  
  - All the functions related to the boards can be found under boardFuncs.py (i.e., randomly generated boards and board solver)
  - All the GUI functions, input boxes and whatnot can be found under GUIFunctions
  
  - will need pygame installed to run
